# Crime Rates Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing crime rates in Los Angeles using publicly available data from the LA City Government Open Data Portal. The primary goal is to leverage data analytics techniques using **Python** and **Power BI** to uncover meaningful insights about crime trends, patterns, and hotspots. These insights can help law enforcement agencies and policymakers in making data-driven decisions for public safety

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Obtain and preprocess crime data using Python (pandas, numpy).
- **Analysis**: Explore trends across time, geography, and crime categories.
- **Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards using Power BI.
- **Decision Support**: Provide actionable insights to assist crime prevention and policy formulation.

## 📂 Data Source

- **Provider**: [LA City Government Open Data Portal](https://data.lacity.org/)
- **Dataset**: Contains 1211 records with 27 columns including:
  - `year_occ`, `month_occ`, `dr_no`, `area_name`, `crm_cd_desc`, `time_occ`, etc.
  - Crime categories, timestamps, locations (latitude/longitude), and descriptive fields.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Google Colab)**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `datetime`
- **Power BI**: Dashboards, heatmaps, category-wise trend visualization
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used in Power BI for custom calculations

---

## 📊 Visualization Techniques

- **Bar Charts**: Frequency of different crime types
- **Line Charts**: Monthly/yearly crime trends
- **Heatmaps**: Geospatial hotspots of crime
- **Time Analysis**: Distribution by time of day and weekday/weekend

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **High Crime Types**: Vehicle theft, battery, burglary, vandalism
- **Temporal Trends**: Peak hours between **6 PM and 2 AM**, and during **weekends**
- **Seasonality**: Crime spikes during **summer and holidays**
- **Geographic Hotspots**: 77th Street, Central, Southwest, Hollywood
- **Victim Demographics**:
  - **Age Group**: Most affected are aged **20-40**
  - **Gender**: Males (47.78%) slightly more frequent victims than females (41.58%)

---

## 🧠 Predictive (Optional)

- Time-series forecasting indicates seasonal increases in crime
- Clustering analysis groups neighborhoods into **high**, **medium**, and **low risk** zones

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can aid public safety initiatives by:
- Identifying **crime-prone locations and times**
- Highlighting **at-risk demographics**
- Supporting **proactive policing** and **resource allocation**
